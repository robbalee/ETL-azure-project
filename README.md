# ETL Azure Project

## Project Overview
This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts data from various sources, transforms it according to business rules, and loads it into a target storage.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Azure SDK
- Apache Airflow (or Azure Data Factory)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/etl-azure-project.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- To run the ETL pipeline, execute the orchestration script:
  ```bash
  python orchestration/orchestrate_etl.py
  ```

## Using Azure Data Factory
1. **Set Up Azure Data Factory**
   - Create an Azure Data Factory instance in the Azure portal.
   - Set up linked services for your data sources and target storage.

2. **Create Data Pipelines**
   - Define data pipelines in ADF to manage the ETL process.
   - Create activities for data extraction, transformation, and loading.

3. **Configure Data Flows**
   - Use ADF's Data Flow feature to design data transformation logic.
   - Configure source and sink transformations.

4. **Schedule and Monitor Pipelines**
   - Set up triggers to schedule pipeline runs.
   - Monitor pipeline execution and handle errors.

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the pipelines with sample data to ensure correctness.
   - Validate the data transformation and loading processes.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the ADF pipelines to a production environment.
   - Set up monitoring and alerting for the ETL process.

7. **Documentation**
   - Document the ADF pipelines, including data sources, transformation logic, and target storage.

8. **Maintenance and Optimization**
   - Monitor the ETL process and optimize performance as needed.
   - Update the pipelines to accommodate changes in data sources or requirements.
